testAllSAR for results replicated from paper.

If you want to create features and labels, go to MainCode<convertSAR.

If you want to sort/filter preexisting features and labels, go to MainCode<makenewlabels.

If you want to create networks, go to MainCode<trainall. Training labels and features can be found in
the folder Training Data, with a readme file describing different sets of labels and features.

If you want to make features for a test image, use the function [allfeaturestest] = testimgconvert(BeforeImage,AfterImage).
Sample test image features can be found in Test Data>Test Features.

If you want to test specific networks and images with a ground truth image, 
go to TestData<test sar images< testAllSAR.

If you want to test all the networks that are pretrained (in the networks folder you can find many folders and
readme files describing different networks), go to TestData<test sar images<evalall. To change the image you 
must go to evalSAR and load in features,images,and ground truth. Thresholds have yet to be implemented for this, as
they change with the image.

If you want to test different levels of speckle noise in artificial images, go to TestData<experiment 1<testSpeckleIntensity.

THE FOLLOWING REQUIRE THE IMAGE PROCESSING TOOLBOX:
If you want to test different types of noise in artificial images normalized, go to TestData<experiment 2<noiseTest.

If you want to test different types of noise in artificial images with the images normalized, 
go to TestData<experiment 2<varianceTest.

If you want to test different types of noise in artificial images with the images not normalized, 
go to TestData<experiment 2<varianceTestIndependent.

Folders:
Main Code:
Contains the code to create features and labels for images and train networks.

Networks:
Many folders of different sets of networks with different parameters. The number at the end of each
indicates the size of the training set, bbdbn indicates a bernoulli-bernoulli RBM, gbdbn indicates
a gaussian-bernoulli RBM. Each folder has a readme file describing the structure of the networks 
trained as well as the parameters used.

Test Data:
Includes all the code to test the networks, as well as test features and labels for sar images as 
well as images used for testing.

Training Data:
Contains all the data, features, and labels used to train  the networks.

Results:
Includes excel charts for different networks prediscovery of the threshold, as well as results of
the experiments and a written word document describing the results. 

Neural Toolbox:
The neural network toolbox created by Masayuka Tanaki that was used in this project.

Preclassification:
Preclassification code for each set of images.

All Images:
All images used for testing and training during the project.
